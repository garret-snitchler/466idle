# Model MVC Web App

This project aims to be an example for developing an architecture-first web app. The team chose an incremental (clicker) game to demonstate this due to its straight-forward nature. Other architectural design patterns could be applicable, but the team implemented MVC for its seperation of responsibilities, increasing readability and modularity.
